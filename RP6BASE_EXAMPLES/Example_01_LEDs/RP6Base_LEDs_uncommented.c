// Uncommented Version of RP6Base_LEDs.c
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Just to show how short this program really is - here it is again (s. also RP6Base_LEDs.c)
// WITHOUT any comments (except for these few lines at the top).
//
// As you can see, the comments make this program *look* much larger than it is.
// They are neccessary to explain what the program does, but you don't need to add that much 
// comments to your own programs and you can leave them short like this one here! 
//
// Maybe this is better to understand for some of you.
// And of course it is easier to use the examples as templates for your own programs 
// like this.
//
// Remember:
// If you want to compile this uncommented program - you need to change the makefile or
// rename this file - or better copy it to a new folder together with the makefile
// and batch files, create a new project etc....
