 * RP6 ROBOT SYSTEM - ROBOT BASE EXAMPLES
 * ****************************************************************************
 * Example: Serial Interface Example - Question and Answer
 * Author(s): Dominik S. Herwald
 * Version 2.0 --> Updated 10.09.2007 to support new UART Reception routines
 * 				   in the RP6 Libary! The program now also has some new 
 *				   features - e.g. it now checks if user really enteres a 
 *				   number... 
 * 
 * ****************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * This sample program shows how to use the RP6Library functions to receive
 * data with the serial interface. It is a "Question and Answer" program. 
 * It is a bit longer, but don't be afraid - the next programs are a lot
 * shorter again. Also have a look at the uncommented version of this program!
 *
 *
 * For THIS example you need to change Terminal send on enter character to LF!
 * Do not use CR+LF or CR only for the serial terminal. 
 * This is only important if you use the WLAN expansion Module as this
 * uses CR+LF and not LF like the other RP6 examples. The Selftest program 
 * supports both, this program can only be used with LF for simplicity reasons.
 * It also works with CR+LF, but may act a bit weird. 
 *
 * ############################################################################
 * The Robot does NOT move in this example! You can simply put it on a table
 * next to your PC and you should connect it to the PC via the USB Interface!
