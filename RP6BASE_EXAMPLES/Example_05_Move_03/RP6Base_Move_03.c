 * RP6 ROBOT SYSTEM - ROBOT BASE EXAMPLES
 * ****************************************************************************
 * Example: Movement 3
 * Author(s): Dominik S. Herwald
 * ****************************************************************************
 * Description:
 *
 * The Robot moves in a Rectangle and changes direction after each cycle.
 * It does not react on any obstacles!
 *
 * You need to calibrate the RP6 Encoder resolution and rotation factors 
 * and set them in the File "RP6Config.h" in the RP6Library folder.
 * Otherwise the angles will not even be roughly accurate.
 *
 * Even with calibration the robot will not drive in an accurate rectangle, 
 * there will always be errors - more or less. On the first cycle you will not 
 * notice too big errors, but latest after the third cycle you will see that 
 * the robot is several cm away from the intended path and the angle is 
 * not accurate.
 *
 * THIS IS NORMAL! Tracked drive systems always have some wheel/tracks slippery
 * and thus the driven distance is often not the distance the encoders have
 * measured. This depends on surface - it will not work that well on any 
 * slippery surfaces!  
 *
 * This is an accumulative error - if one rotation is wrong by 1°, ALL
 * subsequent rotations will have an absolute error of 1° (seen from the 
 * startpoint and the intended waypath) and if one more of the subsequent 
 * rotations is wrong by 2°, all subsequent rotations will have 3° absolute error, 
 * even if the relative rotation is accurate.
 * Now image 5 rotations out of 10 are wrong by 3°, then you have an absolute 
 * error of 15°.
 *
 * The Encoders are very good for speed regulation and when you move straight
 * forwards - well - and for roughly accurate rotations with 1 to 10° error.
 * When moving forwards you don't have much wheel or track slippery and thus
 * you can drive quite accurate distances. 
 * The rotational errors could be corrected by using additional sensors like
 * electronics compasses or optical floor sensors that can be found in 
 * every optical mice for example.
